          <h1>Welcome to Hangman!</h1>
          <p>
            In this classic word-guessing game, your mission is to uncover a
            secret word by guessing one letter at a time. Each correct guess
            reveals all occurrences of the letter in the word, while each
            incorrect guess brings you one step closer to being hanged.
            <br /><br />
            To play, simply choose a letter from the English alphabet and input
            it into the game. If the letter is part of the secret word, it will
            be revealed in its correct position(s). However, if the letter is
            not in the word, a part of the hangman will be drawn.<br /><br />
            Your goal is to guess all the letters in the word before the entire
            hangman is drawn. Be careful, as too many incorrect guesses will
            lead to your defeat! <br /><br />Remember, every word you encounter
            is chosen randomly, so each game presents a new challenge. Test your
            vocabulary, sharpen your guessing skills, and have fun playing
            Hangman! <br /><br />
            Before diving into the game, take a moment to customize your
            experience by adjusting the settings on the right side of the
            screen. These settings allow you to tailor the game according to
            your preferences.
